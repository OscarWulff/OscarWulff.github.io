## Introduction  
San Francisco's crime data tells a story of urban life across two decades. Using official police reports from 2003-2024, we examine how different offenses have evolved and where stolen property incidents cluster most intensely.

## Diverging Crime Trends

*Fig 1: Yearly trends for 10 major crime categories (solid line = count, dashed = % of total crimes)*

Key observations from the time series:
- **Category Variation**: Each crime type shows unique fluctuations rather than moving in unison
- **Percentage vs. Count**: Some crimes (like LARCENY/THEFT) show different stories when viewed as counts versus percentages of total crimes
- **Notable Peaks**: Multiple categories show their highest points between 2012-2015
- **Recent Declines**: Most categories display downward trends post-2020

The dual-axis visualization reveals that a crime's raw count doesn't always match its relative prevalenceâ€”important context for policy decisions.

*Fig 2: Geographic concentration of stolen property reports over time (darker = more reports)*

The animated heatmap shows:
- **Persistent Zones**: Certain areas maintain high activity across all years
- **District Variations**: Clear boundaries between high/low incident areas
- **Temporal Shifts**: Some neighborhoods show changing patterns, particularly after 2015
- **Data Density**: The downtown core shows the most intense clustering

This spatial view helps identify where prevention efforts might have the greatest impact.
